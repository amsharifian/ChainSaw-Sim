This, openif, is a small helper program that is used by Simics when
connecting to the network of the host machine. It performs the actions
for which super-user privileges are needed (opening the raw network
interface).

It needs to be run as root, and should therefore be installed as
setuid root. Source code is provided, to allow for inspection and
audit for security problems. The code has been subjected to reasonable
scrutiny, but if you find a problem with it, please tell us
immediately.

Of course, letting any user run openif as root is equivalent to giving
her/him full access to the network interfaces. This may not be enough
for a privilege escalation, but it should not be installed that way in
an untrusted or hostile environment.

# Use this file as a skeleton for your own device implementation in Python.

# First, the following structured comments are required. They must come first
# in the file, preceded only by comments and blank lines:

# MODULE: sample-device-python
# CLASS: sample-device-python

# The MODULE line gives the name of this module, and each CLASS line names
# a configuration class defined by the module (there can be zero or more).
#
# Note that Python source file names must not contain dashes ("-"), so
# this file is called "sample_device_python.py".

# But do not forget to "make" the module before trying it.

   The breakpoint interface are implemented by any object who supports
   breaking on an address range.

   <insert-until text="// ADD INTERFACE breakpoint_interface"/>

   Most functions in the interface get the <i>object</i> and the
   <i>bp</i> arguments as in-parameters. Object is the object
   implementing this interface and bp is a structure that is used to
   identify the breakpoint. bp is of type <b>breakpoint_t</b> and is
   declared like this:

   <name index="true">breakpoint_t</name>
   <smaller>
   <insert id="breakpoint_t def"/>
   <insert id="struct breakpoint"/>
   </smaller>

   <b>insert_breakpoint</b> are called when a breakpoint is added on
   the object. This can be done with the break command or with
   the SIM_breakpoint API function.
   
   <b>remove_breakpoint</b> should remove the breakpoint and further
   accesses to the address range should not stop the simulation.

   <b>remove_breakpoint_range</b> is called when a range should be
   removed from a breakpoint. It is thus possible to create holes in
   the range. See SIM_breakpoint_remove. <i>access</i> is what kind of
   accesses should be removed. See SIM_breakpoint for a description of
   the access parameter.

   <b>get_breakpoint_ranges</b> should return a list of ranges
   currently set.  <type><idx>breakpoint_range_t</idx></type> is
   declared like this:
   
   <insert id="breakpoint_range_t def"/>
   <insert id="struct breakpoint_range"/>

   <b>get_breakpoints</b> should return a vector of breakpoints set on
   the object matching <i>access</i> and <i>type</i>. See
   SIM_breakpoint for a description of access and type.
   <b>breakpoint_vector_t</b> is declared like this:

   <insert id="breakpoint_vector_t"/>

  Common dma definitions. All dma devices implements this interface.

  The existing dma devices don't implement all of the
  functions. Some don't have DMA_READ_DATA_ADDR,
  DMA_WRITE_DATA_ADDR and DMA_ENABLE_CALL.
   
  Some may not support DMA_SET_INTERRUPT and DMA_CLR_INTERRUPT.
 */

/* DMA Interface
 * Parameters:
 * 1 the dma device
 * 2 the number of the dma channel (0 if device has only one)
 * 3 pointer to data buffer
 * size of transaction
 * + The addr versions have an extra parameter, (number 2) that is
 *   the address where data is read/written
 * + The dma_transfer_time_t has the following parameters:
 *   dma-device, dma-channel, transfer-len
